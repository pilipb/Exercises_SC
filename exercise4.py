#  Create a NumPy array r that contains 20 random numbers between 1 and 9 that from a uniform distribution. Print the result.

import numpy as np

r = np.random.randint(1, 10, 20)
print(r)

# Logical indexing provides a quick way to access and modify entries in a NumPy
# array that satisfy certain criteria. In this question, weâ€™ll use logical indexing to
# replace all of the entries in r that are smaller than 5 with 0. First, run the command
# idx = r < 5. Print the value of idx. Explain the result you see. Now run the
# command r[idx] = 0 and print the value of r. What has happened?

idx = r < 5
print(idx) # returns a boolean array with True for values less than 5 and False for values greater than 5

r[idx] = 0
print(r) # all values less than 5 are now 0
